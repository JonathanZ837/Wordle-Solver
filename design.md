For the initial guess, I will choose a word with the 5 most common letters (which I will just search up), and then make sure that there are no repeat letters. The results of the guesses (g,y, or n) can be stored in a char array, and I can just iterate through the remaining possible words and see if they "fit" the criteria based on the responses. For duplicate letters, I need make sure that if it is a n, but has a g or y of the same letter earlier, then it is treated differently. I need to go through all the duplicate letter cases and make sure that there are a correct amount of letters in the word, and remove if it violates one of the rules. For picking the next guess, I can use the word frequency csv, and simply pick the word with the highest csv, using a HashMap and finding the max value of frequency of the remaining words.
